/**
 * Lab 02:
 *
 * Implement a number guessing game component.
 *
 * The component should provide an input field for the user to guess a
 * number picked randomly by the computer (from 1 to 1,000).
 * When typing a number, the component should print "too low" or "too high" 
 * as a hint to the user.
 *
 * To make the game interesting, computer should sometimes cheat and print wrong messages.
